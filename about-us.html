    <div class="about-description">
      <p>We are driven by a passion for our calling and we practice exceptional veterinary medicine. But that‚Äôs not the only reason why our clients drive past many other veterinarians to get to our doors.</p><br><br>
      <p>We have built a culture of looking after our patients from their day to day needs and ailments to serious medical problems, from puppyhood through senior care and from things as simple as nail clips to complex neurosurgery. It is important to us that you feel you can trust us, that your pet is receiving the best care there is.</p>

      <p>
        With our satellite clinics in Mumbai which are located at Churchgate and Powai and in Goa in Porvorim, we we aim to make veterinary care more convenient for our loyal clients that may not be able to make the long commute to our specialty centre at Mahalaxmi.
      </p><br><br>
      <p>
        We are aiming to build something special for our clients and patients. Everything we do is motivated by our belief in improving the lives of pets and their human families. We have found so much room for innovation in the modern veterinary experience‚Ä¶from the tools we use, our staff‚Äôs skill development, the way we diagnose cases and the solutions we offer, to the way we work and partner with our clients to cater to our patient‚Äôs health and happiness.
