        <h1>Ophthalmology</h1>
        <p>Although routine eye exams can frequently be handled by our general veterinarians, sometimes the problems may be serious and require special attention. </p>
        <p>Our fully equipped ophthalmology unit with a range of diagnostic and surgical equipment allows us to diagnose and effectively treat eye conditions. Eye surgeries are performed to correct debilitating diseases like cataracts, dry eye, and corneal ulcers and glaucoma. </p>
        <p>Other procedures are also performed for achieving the goals of protecting corneas affected by laceration or ulceration, removing prolapsed lens or excision of eye or eyelid masses.</p>

        <h1>Cardiac Care</h1>
        <p>We recommend all animals over 7 years of age have an annual cardiac check. Diagnosis is done via most advanced diagnostic tests, including echocardiography, electrocardiography, radiographs, blood pressure checks, and if necessary Holter monitor recordings and cardiac catheterization, which can successfully diagnose heart disease in animals based on these essential tests and physical examination findings </p>
        <p>Treatment options are chosen according to the patient animal’s condition. Early diagnosis and appropriate therapy of cardiac conditions can help the pet to live a longer and healthier life.</p>

        <h1>LAMENESS CLINICS: COMBINING NEUROLOGY, ORTHOPAEDICS AND PHYSIOTHERAPY</h1>
        <p>Is your dog limping? Has your regular vet been unable to find the cause of the limp? Are current treatments not improving your dog’s lameness? </p>
        <p>At PetNest, we have a particular focus on diagnosing and treating lameness in dogs. Several of our vets and our certified physiotherapists have a special interest in canine musculoskeletal problems, as well as many years of experience in ‘hard to diagnose’ lameness cases.</p>
        <p> We are also proud to provide a number of treatment protocols and surgical options that many other veterinary clinics are not able to offer.</p>

        <h1>Dentistry</h1>
        <p>Poor dental health affects every internal organ in an animal’s body including the heart, kidneys, and liver. Dental procedures require anesthesia, but when done on a routine basis the procedure is quick, less expensive, and the health reward far outweighs the risk. </p>
        <p> PetNest offers dental treatment for peridontal disease, gingivitis and stomatitis, as well as oral Medicine and Surgery for numerous conditions in the mouth.</p>
